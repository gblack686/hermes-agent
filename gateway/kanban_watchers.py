"""Kanban board watcher methods for GatewayRunner.

Extracted verbatim from ``gateway/run.py`` (god-file decomposition Phase 3).
These are the background-loop methods that subscribe to kanban boards, deliver
notifications/artifacts, and drive the multi-agent dispatcher. They use only
``self`` state, so they live on a mixin that ``GatewayRunner`` inherits — the
``self._kanban_*`` call sites resolve identically via the MRO, making this a
behavior-neutral move that lifts ~1,000 LOC out of run.py.
